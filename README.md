# Azure Cosmos DB for Multitenant Applications Workshop

## Azure Cosmos DB Introduction

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database for modern multitenant application development. You can build applications 
fast with open source APIs, multiple SDKs, schemaless data and no-ETL analytics over operational data.
Single-digit millisecond response times, and instant scalability, guarantee speed at any scale.
Guarantee business continuity, 99.999% availability and enterprise-grade security for every application.
End-to-end database management, with serverless and automatic scaling matching your application and TCO needs. 
Supports multiple database APIs including native API for NoSQL, API for Mongo DB, Apache Cassandra, Apache Gremlin and Table.
It also started supporting PostgreSQL extended with the Citus Open Source which is useful for highly scalable relational apps.

To begin using Azure Cosmos DB, create an Azure Cosmos DB account in an Azure resource group in your subscription. 
You then create databases and containers within the account.

#### Resource Model:
A single Azure Cosmos DB account can virtually manage an unlimited amount of data and provisioned throughput. 
To manage your data and provisioned throughput, you can create one or more databases within your account, 
then one or more containers to store your data.

#### Request Units: 
Cost of database operations is normalized by Azure Cosmos DB and is expressed by Request Units (RU). It is a performance 
currency abstracting the system resources such as CPU, IOPS and Memory to perform the database operations supported by 
Azure Cosmos DB. You can examine the response header to track the number of RUs that are consumed by any database 
operation.

#### Indexing: 
Azure Cosmos DB is a schema-agnostic database that allows you to iterate on your application without having to deal with schema 
or index management. By default, Azure Cosmos DB automatically indexes every property for all items in your container without 
having to define any schema or configure secondary indexes. When an item is written, Azure Cosmos DB effectively indexes each 
property's path and its corresponding value. In some situations, you may want to override this automatic behavior to better 
suit your requirements. You can customize a container's indexing policy by setting its indexing mode, and include or exclude 
property paths.

Access [Azure Cosmos DB Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) for more details and training.

## Multi-Tenancy features for Software Companies 

### Distributes Data horizontally
By using partitions with Azure Cosmos DB containers, you can create containers that are shared across multiple tenants. 
With large containers, Azure Cosmos DB spreads your tenants across multiple physical nodes to achieve a high degree of scale.

### Control the **throughput** based on the size of the customer to lower your costs: 
Typically, you provision a defined number of request units per second for your workload, which is referred 
to as throughput. You can assign throughput at a container level, at a database level to share among the containers, automatically
scale up to the max throughput for address unpredicted workloads and scale down to 10% of Max to save costs.

    
## Business Scenario
Fictitious ISV company called "Smart Booking Inc" has built an on-line reservation application called "EasyReserveApp" and 
currently deployed as an on-premises application to 4 hotel chains. This application is a big hit in the industry and 
they want to convert this application as a SaaS application to meet the global demand. They are looking for a database 
to handle unpredictable volume, maintain low latency response time to users at any part of the world, maintain high 
availability & business continuity with optimized cost based on the usage. 

It currently has the following clients in the Hotel Industry:

<img src="./images/MultiTenant_Hotel_Business_Model.jpg" alt="Application Data Model Architecture" Width="600" Height="400">


This workshop gives you handson experience on designing Azure Cosmos DB for small, medium and large multi-tenant 
customers using this use case.  


## Architecture Solution Diagram
<img src="./images/Multi-Tenant_Cosmos_DB_Workshop_Architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture for Azure Cosmos DB Lab" Width="600"> 


## Challenge-1: Model data to build SaaS applications
Let us review the object model for this application and plan the data model for SaaS application.

### Multi-Tenant Reservation System Object Model

**Business_Entity** object contains all the business entity data.
**Tenant** object contains the tenant location address and contact info.
**Hotel_Room** object contains catalog of rooms with type, view, number of beds etc.
**Customers** object has all the customer profile data. 
**Room_Inventory** object contains all the room numbers with room type in each tenant location.
**Room_Availability** object contains available dates with rate info for each tenant location.
**Hotel_Reservations** object contains all the hotel reservations for each tenant location.

<img src="./images/MultiTenant_Hotel_Business_Software_Object_Model.jpg" alt="Multi-Tenant Reservation System Object Model" Width="600">

### Access Patterns

1) Provide Hotel Room availability to support customer search based on location, dates and room types.
2) Need to update availability after customer completes the reservation.
3) Customer will access the reservation to review, cancel or update. 
4) Business owners and the support team at each tenant location will access the availability to 
book/change reservation as per their customer request. 

You would want to keep all the relevant data in one object based on the highly frequent access patterns to write and read data.

<img src="./images/CosmosDB_MultiTenant_Hotel_Business_Data_Model.jpg" alt="Cosmos DB Document Model diagram" width="800">

As per the above diagram, it make sense to keep all the business entity information such as customers and room types 
along with tenant related data such as room inventory, availability and reservations in one Cosmos DB Container. 

This challenge demonstrate how software object model transform to NoSQL database design model which completely different from SQL based
databases. **Cosmos DB Data Model requires a different mindset and also requires the knowledge of highly frequent access patterns.**

Apply the same methodology to migrate your legacy applications or to build new green field applications. **You have successfully 
completed challenge 2 by creating a Cosmos DB data model based on highly frequent access patterns!!**


## Challenge-2: Deploy Azure Cosmos DB Service

## Challenge-3: Design Cosmos DB Account to serve small, medium and large customers

Evaluate options to keep relevant data in one logical partition using partitioning key.


### Database Strategies to support small, medium and large customers

#### Shared throughput for small business entities

It would be better to create one container per business entity and share the throughput at the database level. This will avoid 
creating one database per each customer and saves lot of money. You will have to understand that it may cause noisy neighbor 
problem. This approach tends to work well when the amount of data stored for each tenant is small. 

It can be a good choice for building a pricing model that includes a free tier, and for business-to-consumer (B2C) solutions. 
In general, by using shared containers, you achieve the highest density of tenants and therefore the lowest price 
per tenant.

#### 3.1 Create Cosmos DB Containers with shared database throughput

* Access Cosmos DB Service in Azure Portal.
* Select **Data Explorer** from the left panel.
* Select **SharedThroughputDB** database.
* Expand **CasinoHotel** container. 
* select **Settings**.
* You will see **tenantId** as the partition key. It will create logical partitions per each tenant location. 

* Verify FamilyFunHotel Container for the partition key.
* Select **Scale** property under **SharedThroughputDB** database.
* It is set to use Autoscale up to 2,000 RUs and will share across all the containers (business entities). 

Autoscale will fall back to 200 RUs (10% of max RUs) when no activity. **This will save lot money since you don't have to allocate 
the maximum capacity all the time.**

**This database models serves multiple customers with multi-tenant data models with AutoScale capability to lower the costs and avoids 
creating single database per customer.**

<img src="./images/sharedThroughputContainers_3d.jpg" alt="Shared Throughtput at Database level" width="800" >

#### Dedicated throughput to avoid Noisy Neighbor
Hiking Hotel is a medium size business entity and you can avoid noisy neighbor issue by providing a dedicated throughput at 
the container level. Follow the steps to create a dedicated throughput as part of the shared throughput database.

#### 3.2 Add Cosmos DB container with dedicated throughput under shared database throughput 

Follow the steps to provision a new container with a dedicated throughput in a shared throughput database.  

* Select **New Container** from the top bar inside Data Explorer.
* Select **ShardThroughputDB** under **Use existing** database dropdown 
* Type **HikingHotel** as the container name
* Type **/tenantId** as partition key.
* Select **Provision dedicated throughput for this container** option.
* Set the **Container Max RUs** as 2000.
* click **OK**

<img src="./images/create_SharedThroughputContainers_3d.jpg" alt="Create dedicated throughput container" width="800">


#### Database per business entity
You can provision dedicated containers for each business entity. This can work well for isolating large customers with higher 
throughput requirement and for providing dedicated capacity. It will provide guaranteed level of performance, serve medium size 
customers.

#### 3.3 Create Cosmos DB Database to serve large customers

* Select **DedicatedThroughputDB** database
* Expand **GoodFellas** container.
* Select **Scale & Settings** 
* It shows 1000 RUs as the Maximum RUs with Autoscale throughput option.

<img src="./images/DedicatedThroughputDB_3d.jpg" atl="dedicated database for large customers" width="800">

#### Account for tenant
You can provision separate database accounts for each tenant, which provides the highest level of isolation, 
but the lowest density. A single database account is dedicated to a tenant, which means they are not subject to 
the noisy neighbor problem. You can also configure the location of the container data via replication according to the 
tenant's requirements, and you can tune the configuration of Azure Cosmos DB features, network access, backup policy, 
geo-replication and customer-managed encryption keys, to suit each tenant's requirements.

#### Hybrid Approaches
You can consider a combination of the above approaches to suit different tenants' requirements and your pricing model. 
For example:
* Provision all free trial customers within a shared container, and use the tenant ID or a synthetic key partition key.
* Offer a higher Silver tier that provisions dedicated throughput for the tenant's container.
* Offer the highest Gold tier, and provide a dedicated database account for the tenant, which also allows tenants to 
select the geography for their deployment.

#### Partitioning Key Design

To store multi-tenant data in a single container, Azure Cosmos DB provides **partition key** to distribute the data into logical
partitions. By using tenantId as the partition key, Cosmos DB keeps the data for each tenant in one logical partition and will 
perform faster queries with low cost. 

Partition Key plays a major role to save costs and to provide sub millisecond response time. Make sure to keep the partition key 
as part of most frequent queries. Cosmos DB also provides Document Type to keep relevant data in one container. 


#### 3.4 Load Business data into containers

Download the Workshop Data zip file (Multi-Tenant_CosmosDB_Workshop_data.zip) from the provided github link data folder. 
Unzip the file into your local folder and you should see the following files.

<img src="./images/MultiTenant_dataFile_list_3d.jpg" alt="list of multi-tenant reservation and availability data" width="600" >


Multi-Tenant databases have unique set of data per each tenant in our use case number of rooms, availability and reservations. It 
would make sense to create TenantID as the partition key and collect room availability and reservation info using document type.

You can also keep reference data such as Guest info and room type definitions in the same container. 

##### 3.4.1 Load Room Availability and Reservation data into **CasinoHotel** Container. 
* Expand **Casino Hotels** container under **SharedThroughputDB** database
* select **items** section
* Select **upload** to load the data files from the local foldder.
* Select **CasinoHotel_RoomInventory.json** file from the local folder.
* Select Open
* Click **Upload** button.
<img src="./images/UploadMultiTenantData_3d.jpg" alt="Load Data into Casion Hotel Container" width="800" >

* Load Reservation data into the same container by selecting **CasinoHotel_Reservation.json** file.

##### 3.4.2 Load Room Availability and Reservation data into **FamilyFunHotel** Container. 
* Follow the above steps to load the data.

##### 3.4.3 Load Room Availability and Reservation data into **HikingHotel** Container. 
* Follow the above steps to load the data.

##### 3.4.4 Load Room Availability and Reservation data into **GoodFellasHotel** Container. 
* Follow the above steps to load the data.


#### 3.5 Query Data using Data Explorer

You can query data using APIs and also can use Data Explorer for quick check.

* Select **CasinoHotel** container.
* Open Query window by selecting 'Folder with Search' icon from the top bar.
* Type the following Query 

``` SELECT count(1) FROM c where c.type='Reservation' ```

* Select 'Execute Selection' from the top bar to execute the query
* Results tab will be display the results on the bottom.
* Query Stats next to results tab will show RU cost, size of the document and Query Execution time.

<img src="./images/cosmosdb-query-execution-3d.jpg" alt="Query data using Data Explorer" width="600" >

With this challenge you have gained a hands-on experience to create multi-tenant Cosmos DB database to support small, medium 
and large customers. Congratulations!!


## Challenge-4: Validate Cosmos DB features Auto failover, Autoscale and Low latency


### 4.1 High Availability Features:
Azure Cosmos DB is designed to provide multiple features and configuration options to achieve high availability to satisfy 
the mission critical enterprise application's requirement.

### Replica Outages
Replica outages refer to outages of individual nodes in an Azure Cosmos DB cluster deployed in an 
Azure region. Azure Cosmos DB automatically mitigates replica outages by guaranteeing at least three replicas of your 
data in each Azure region for your account within a four replica quorum.

### Zone Outages
In many Azure regions, it is possible to distribute your Azure Cosmos DB cluster across 
availability zones, which results increased SLAs, as availability zones are physically separate and provide 
distinct power source, network, and cooling. See Availability Zones. When an Azure Cosmos DB account is 
deployed using availability zones, Azure Cosmos DB provides RTO = 0 and RPO = 0 even with a zone outage.

Select 'Replicate data globally' under 'Settings' section in the left pane. It show all the available regions 
for Cosmos DB deployment. Availability Zone option for the write region can be enabled at the time of account creation.

select "+ Add region" to add a read region. Check the box for 'Availability Zone'. **No save action needed for this lab.**

<img src="./images/Deploy_CosmosDBMultTenant_Lab_CosmosDB_add_region_save.jpg" alt="Region availability zones" width="800">

### Region Outages
Region outages refer to the outages that affect all Azure Cosmos DB nodes in an Azure region, across all availability 
zones. In the rare cases of region outages, Azure Cosmos DB can be configured to support various outcomes of 
durability and availability

#### Durability: 
To protect against complete data loss that may result from catastrophic disasters in a region, Azure 
Cosmos DB provides continuous and periodic backup modes.  

#### Service-Managed failover: 
It allows Azure Cosmos DB to fail over the write region of multi-region account. Region 
failovers are detected and handled by Azure and do not require any changes from the application.

Select "Service-Managed Failover" option to failover the database to read region at the time of region outage.

<img src="./images/Cosmosdb_feature_Automatic_Failover.jpg" alt="Auto failover feature" width="800">

Select the "On" button under "Enable Service-Managed Failover".

<img src="./images/CosmosDB_feature_Service_Managed_Failover_TurnOn.jpg" alt="Auto failover feature" width="800" height="500">

**No action is needed for this lab.** It will take time to enable the failover option.


### 4.2 Autoscale for scalability
It allows you to scale the throughput (RU/s) of your database or container automatically and instantly. 
The throughput is scaled based on the usage, without impacting the availability, latency, throughput, or 
performance of the workload.

Autoscale provisioned throughput is well suited for mission-critical workloads that have variable or unpredictable 
traffic patterns, and require SLAs on high performance and scale.

Select 'Data Explorer' from the left pane and expand 'DedicatedThroughputDB' database. 

Expand **GoodFellasHotel** container.
Select **Scale & Settings** setting.

Change Max RU/s back to '2000' and select **save** button on the top bar. 

It will change the throughput instantly without impacting the current workloads.

<img src="./images/DedicatedThroughputDB_3d.jpg" atl="dedicated database for large customers" width="800">


### Sub Millisecond Fast Response Time
Select 'Data Explorer' from the left pane and expand 'SharedThroughputDB' database.
Hover over 'CasinoHotel' container and select three dots.
It provide options to create SQL Query, Stored Procedure, UDF & Trigers. Select the 'New SQL Query' option. 

<img src="./images/cosmosdb-query-execution-3d.jpg" alt="Query data using Data Explorer" width="600" >

Type the following Query:

```
SELECT * FROM c where c.type='Reservation' 
```

select "Query Stats" tab and check the Query execution time. It shows the sub millisecond response time.


## Challenge-5: Build an application using Azure Cosmos DB at no cost  
Cosmos DB is a developer friendly database and supports SaaS applications with no schema and indexing to manage. 
It also provides built in Cache for improved performance. It provides Cosmos DB Emulator tool to build your
